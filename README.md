Abhiyantrikotsav 2k25 - A Fest Website Project
This repository showcases the official website I developed for Abhiyantrikotsav 2k25, the annual technical festival of the School of Engineering at the Central University of Karnataka. This project serves as a demonstration of my skills in front-end web development, UI/UX design, and creating interactive, multi-lingual user experiences.


‚ú® Features I Implemented
Futuristic Design: I designed and built a modern, high-tech interface featuring a "glassmorphism" style and a dynamic, animated particle background using vanilla JavaScript.


Fully Responsive: I ensured the layout is optimized for a seamless experience on all devices, from mobile phones to desktop computers, using Tailwind CSS.


Multi-Language Support: I implemented a complete translation system from scratch, allowing the website content to be dynamically switched between English, Tamil, Telugu, Kannada, Malayalam and Hindi.


Two-Page Structure:


Homepage (index.html): Introduces the fest, highlights key dates and the venue, and provides an "About" section.


Events Page (events.html): A dedicated page showcasing all the technical and cultural events with clear descriptions and registration details.


Easy Customization: The code is structured for easy updates to event information, registration links, and text content.


üöÄ Tech Stack
The website is built with a focus on performance and simplicity, using fundamental web technologies:


HTML5: For the core structure and content.

Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework for rapid and responsive UI development.

JavaScript (Vanilla): For the interactive particle background, mobile navigation, and the multi-language translation functionality.

üìÇ Project Structure
The repository is organized into two primary files:

/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.html      # The main landing page of the fest website.

‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ events.html     # The page that lists all the fest events.

üõ†Ô∏è Technical Overview
This section provides a brief overview of the project's technical setup for anyone reviewing the code.

Deployment Info
This is a static website, making it lightweight and easy to host on services like GitHub Pages, Netlify, or Vercel by simply uploading the HTML files.

Content Management
Event Details: All event-related content is managed directly within events.html.

Text & Translations: All text content for the homepage is managed within a single translations object in the <script> tag of index.html, making language updates straightforward.
